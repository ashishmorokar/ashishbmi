Calcula tu IMC | Calculate your BMI

This code has been written in Spanish and using the Metric System, if you are from the US you will have some difficulties while using it.

I recommend using a "Lbs to Kg" and "Feet and Inches to Mts" conversors.

Translation:
"Nombre" means Name.
"Apellido" means Last name.
"Edad" means Age.
"Peso" means Weight.
"Altura" means Height.
"Dirección" means Adress.
"Teléfono" means Phone number.

"Bajo Peso" means Underweight. 
"Peso Normal" means Normal weight. 
"Sobrepeso" means Overweight.
"Obesidad" means Obesity.
